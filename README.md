# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to build an interactive map of recent earthquake data, so that a user could locate where earthquakes had taken place and quickly visualize the relative severity of them. The resulting map includes three different base maps that present views of the world via satellite imagery, streets, and at night. The user is able to click to activate or deactivate layers showing all recent earthquakes, earthquakes above magnitude 4.5, and tectonic fault lines. The size and color of each earthquake marker are scaled to the relative severity of the event, and each marker can be clicked for additional information about the magnitude and location.
